# tests
Payslip Python Challenge 

I'm using unittest for the testing.

I did not figure out the idea behind the 3rd test: The GTN file header structure has changed e.g. there are two header rows instead of one. 
Do I need to have any logic to remember how many rows the header was in the previous version of the Excel spreadsheet?

I did tests 6 and 7, assuming that the mapping information came from the mappings.json file, if I understood correctly.

I'm sorry I had to start the task so late, so I didn't have a chance to ask you any questions to get a better idea of the task and I would be very happy to receive a feedback. Thank you.
